<span style="color:green">Hello there !!</span>.

I am MS(by research) student in [Electrical engineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/pg-students-stream-wise-list#caa) department of [IIT KANPUR](https://www.iitk.ac.in/). My thesis topics lies on intersection of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering domain. I am currently working on Deep learning based fault diagnosis of physical system with the aim of genralizing the diagnosis procedure for different signal signatures. I have good fortune to work with  prof. [K S Venkatesh](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/)(my thesis advisor) and prof N.K Verma.

I have worked around 8 months in Artificial intelligence data analaytics research lab(AIDAR Lab), IIT Kanpur researching solution for smoothing gradient in Generative Adevrsial Networks(GANs), Learning deep learning framework , exploring PSO, Genetic Algorithm, second order derivative method (Hessian Matrix) for conventional first-order gradient Descent. For a short period of time, i also worked on Computer vision problem of Uttarpradesh government forest-wildlife project using YOLO and SSD on top of Inception Net, training the model on custom dataset and finding solution to increase mAP of network.

By the end of 2019, i started working as Senior Student Research Assosciate(SSRA) for DRDO, Goverment of India,(JCBCAT) in their highly interdiscplinary project which goes by name "__Complex Defense Object Recognition And autonomous handling in Unstructured and Noisy outdoor Environment__". In this project, we were icorporating 3-D computer vision with conventional point cloud algorithm(ICP/GICP) so the robotic mainpulator can know the orientaion shape size texture(surface) of Interested object. My work is to create a smooth pipeline for the project, right from sensing point cloud to classfying into interested known categories.
